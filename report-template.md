## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Purpose of the analysis:
    This is an assessment of the ability of logistic regression models to predict consumer credit risk


* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).



## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

Logistic Regression on Original Data:
* Machine Learning Model 1
Balanced accuracy score of 95.2%
Precision of 99% (weighted avg)
Recall of 99% (weighted avg)


* Machine Learning Model 2(Resampled Data):
Balanced accuracy score of 99.4%
Precision of 99% (weighted avg)
Recall of 99% (weighted avg)


## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
